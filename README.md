# Welcome
Hi! Thanks for your interest in our job opening for the DevOps Engineer posititon.
We hope that you will find the problems interesting.

This repository is accompanied with a Trello board, containing the tickets to be
solved.
The problems are systems and networks related, leaning more towards networks, so solving these upfront is a good idea. We're mostly interested in your approach and the different paths you took to solve the problem, so don't worry if a ticket isn't solved completely.

## Installing requirements
Some dependencies need to be installed on your system to be able to run the test
machine.

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Chef DK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)


## Starting up the environment
To run test environment, issue `vagrant up` from the root directory of the repository (where *Vagrantfile* resides).

After the machine is booted, connect to it with `vagrant ssh` and you're ready to go.
